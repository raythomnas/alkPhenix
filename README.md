# alkPhenix

Web store design for Alk Phenix, created at the end of first year study in graphic & web design course (tertiary project) 

Recently returned to after a year of study in a dedicated web and UX design course, i challenged myself to clean up the website as much as possible, removing unnecessary files and code where possible.

Meant to operate as a hi-fi prototype example of a possible alternate design for the Alk Phenix web store, this was my first significant project involving coding, and peaked my interest in web design in general.
